## Description:
 The project is a web application that is fully dynamic and allows for everything on the website to be changed through a database. This means that the website's content, layout, and functionality can be updated and customized without the need for manual coding changes. 

The website is server-side rendered, meaning that the web server generates the HTML and sends it to the client's browser for display. This approach offers several advantages, such as improved performance, search engine optimization, and better accessibility for users with slower internet connections.

The project was created using several popular technologies, including MongoDB, Node.js, Express, and EJS templating. MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, document-based format. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows for server-side scripting and building scalable network applications. Express is a web application framework for Node.js that provides a range of features for building web applications, such as routing and middleware. Finally, EJS is a templating language for generating HTML markup that makes it easier to create dynamic web pages.

The website is also fully responsive, meaning that it can adapt its layout and content to different screen sizes and devices, such as phones and laptops. This is important because it ensures that users can access the website on any device and have a positive user experience. Overall, the project appears to be a modern, dynamic web application built using cutting-edge technologies and best practices.
